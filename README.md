# Penetration-Testing

This project is dedicated to providing step-by-step walkthroughs of vulnerable machines used in penetration testing labs such as TryHackMe, Hack The Box, VulnHub. The goal is to document the entire exploitation process — from enumeration to privilege escalation — in a clear and educational format.
